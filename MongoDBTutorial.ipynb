    "# Introduction to MongoDB with PyMongo and NOAA Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a basic walkthrough of how to use MongoDB and is based on a tutorial originally by [Alberto Negron](http://altons.github.io/python/2013/01/21/gentle-introduction-to-mongodb-using-pymongo/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata records are frequently stored as JSON, and almost anything you get from an API will be JSON. For example, check out the [metadata records](https://data.noaa.gov/data.json) for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a great tool to use with JSON data because it stores structured data as JSON-like documents, using dynamic schemas (called BSON), rather than predefined schemas. \n",
    "\n",
    "In MongoDB, an element of data is called a document, and documents are stored in collections. One collection may have any number of documents. Collections are a bit like tables in a relational database, and documents are like records. But there is one big difference: every record in a table has the same fields (with, usually, differing values) in the same order, while each document in a collection can have completely different fields from the other documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents are Python dictionaries that can have strings as keys and can contain various primitive types (int, float,unicode, datetime) as well as other documents (Python dicts) and arrays (Python lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "First we need to import `json` and `pymongo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `pprint` module provides a capability to “pretty-print” arbitrary Python data structures in a form which can be used as input to the interpreter. This is particularly helpful with JSON. You can read more about `pprint` [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pprint.html)."

The High-Latitude Airborne Annual Expeditions Sever (Sever means North) took place in 1937, 1941, 1948-1952, and 1954-1993 (Konstantinov and Grachev, 2000). In Spring 1993, the last (45th) Sever expedition finished long-term activity in the Arctic. Snow and sea ice data were collected, along with meteorological and hydrological measurements (the latter are not part of this data set). Up to 202 landings were accomplished each year.  The data set contains measurements of 23 parameters, including ice thickness and snow depth on the runway and surrounding area; ridge, hummock, and sastrugi dimensions and areal coverage; and snow density. The sea ice thickness data are of particular importance, as ice thickness measurements for the Arctic Basin are scarce. These data are a subset of those used to create the atlas Morphometric Characteristics of Ice and Snow in the Arctic Basin, self-published by Ilya P.
